# CogniQuery: Your AI Data Scientist
*Submission for FutureHack! A.I. Battlefield 2025*

Hi everyone! We’re the builders of CogniQuery.

### **tl;dr**

We’re building an AI that lets anyone in a company get answers from their database just by asking questions in plain English. Business teams, marketers, and execs use CogniQuery to get from complex business questions to data-backed reports in seconds, not weeks.

### **The Ask**

*   **Try CogniQuery:** The best way to see the magic is to try it. Clone our repo, run `scripts/setup_dataset.py` to load the demo data, and start asking questions.
*   **Connect with us:** If you're a business struggling to unlock your data, or an investor who believes in the future of data accessibility, let's talk.

### **The Problem**

Does your company’s data feel like this? A locked vault that only engineers can open.



Every day, crucial business decisions are delayed because getting a simple report requires a JIRA ticket, a multi-day wait, and several back-and-forth emails with the data team. This friction costs companies millions in missed opportunities and slow execution.

### **The Solution**

CogniQuery is an app that connects to your database and gives every employee their own AI Data Scientist. We don't just translate text-to-SQL; we simulate the workflow of a real human data team.

1.  **Starts with a question** - A business user asks a high-level question like *"Why are our profits a disaster in Southeast Asia?"*
2.  **AI agents collaborate** - A team of specialized AI agents works together in real-time. The Analyst refines the question, the Scientist writes SQL and Python to find the answer and create charts, and the Strategist compiles a report.
3.  **Delivers an insight** - In seconds, you get a full report with charts, uncovering that your best-selling products are secretly unprofitable due to bad discount strategies.

### **How We're Different**

Most "AI for data" tools are thin wrappers around text-to-SQL models. They're brittle and can't handle complex, multi-step business questions.

Our **agentic workflow** is the secret sauce. By using a multi-agent system (powered by `crewai`), CogniQuery can reason, plan, and self-correct. You can literally watch the AI team "think" in our live activity log, making our process transparent and trustworthy.

### **Our Team**

We're a team of developers passionate about building tools that close the gap between humans and data. We spent this hackathon building not just a feature, but the foundation for a platform that could change how every company operates.

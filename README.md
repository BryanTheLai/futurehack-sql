# CogniQuery: The AI Data Team in a Box
*Submission for FutureHack! A.I. Battlefield 2025*

Hi everyone! Weâ€™re the builders of CogniQuery.

### **tl;dr**

We're building an AI that lets anyone talk to their database. Business teams, marketers, and execs use CogniQuery to get from complex questions to visual reports in seconds, without writing a single line of SQL.

### **Ask**

1.  **Try CogniQuery:** Watch our video demo to see it in action.
2.  **Connect us:** If you know a team drowning in data but starved for insights, please introduce us!

### **Problem**

Your companyâ€™s data is a goldmine, but itâ€™s locked in a vault that only engineers can open. Business users have urgent questions, but getting answers means filing a ticket and waiting days, if not weeks.

This slow, frustrating loop costs companies millions in missed opportunities and slow decision-making. Standard "Text-to-SQL" tools often fail because they don't understand business context, leading to wrong queries and useless results.


*Business questions get lost in translation.*

### **Solution**

CogniQuery is a desktop app that gives every employee an on-demand AI data analytics team.

*   **Understands Your Questions:** Go beyond simple keywords. CogniQuery's AI Analyst clarifies ambiguous requests and explores your database schema to understand the real question you're asking.
*   **Writes Code & Builds Charts:** An AI Data Scientist writes the necessary SQL, runs it, and then immediately uses Python to generate stunning, insightful charts.
*   **Delivers a Full Report:** An AI Strategist compiles everything into a clear, executive-ready summary, explaining *what* the data means and *why* it matters.

Our key feature is the **Live Agent Activity Log**, which lets you watch the AI team collaborate in real-time. This builds trust and transparency, showing you exactly how your answer was derived.

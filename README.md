### ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Agentic AI Workflow:** Powered by `crewai`, our system uses specialized AI agents (Analyst, DBA, Scientist, Strategist) that collaborate to solve problems, ensuring more robust and context-aware results than simple text-to-SQL.
-   **Natural Language to Insight:** Go from a simple question like "How did we do last month?" to a full report with charts and analysis in seconds.
-   **Automated Visualizations:** The AI Data Scientist automatically generates the most relevant chart (e.g., bar, line) to visually support the findings.
-   **Transparent Activity Log:** Watch your AI team work in real-time! Our live log shows every thought process, SQL query, and Python script as it happens, building trust and providing full transparency.
-   **Bring-Your-Own-Database (BYOD):** Securely connect to your own NeonDB-compatible database via the UI. Your data stays yours.

### üß† Architectural Deep-Dive: The AI Team Workflow

CogniQuery's power lies in its structured, sequential agentic process. Each agent has a specific role and hands off its work to the next, mimicking a real-world, high-performance data team.

This diagram illustrates the flow of information and the collaboration between the AI agents:

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run CogniQuery on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    *   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
        .\.venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    copy .env.example .env

    # For macOS / Linux
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and add your credentials:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
    NEONDB_CONN_STR="postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname"
    ```
    *Note: You can also leave these blank and enter them directly in the Streamlit UI sidebar.*

5.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your browser should open to the CogniQuery application automatically.

```

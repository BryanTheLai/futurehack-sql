# Southeast Asia vs. Rest of World FY2024 Performance Analysis

## TL;DR (Quantitative and Qualitative)

- **Quantitative:** Southeast Asia recorded a net loss of **-$1,070 profit** on **$4,850 sales** with high discount rates (**0.42** avg), versus Rest of World's **$1,380 profit** on **$4,200 sales** and low discounting (**0.05** avg).
- **Qualitative:** Despite strong sales and demand, Southeast Asia's heavy discounting strategy is eroding all profit, setting the region significantly behind its global peers. Immediate intervention in pricing and discount processes is critical.
